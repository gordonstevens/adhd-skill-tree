    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This document provides explanations for the skills, traits, and strategies represented in the ADHD Skill Tree visualization. It aims to help people better understand ADHD and common management approaches.</p>
    <ul>
      <li id="active_skills_def"><strong>Active Skills:</strong> These are strategies, techniques, and behaviors that individuals with ADHD consciously learn and apply to manage symptoms, improve executive functions, and navigate daily life challenges. They require deliberate effort, practice, and implementation.</li>
      <li id="passive_skills_def"><strong>Passive Skills/Strengths:</strong> This could refer to inherent traits, tendencies, or positive characteristics sometimes associated with ADHD that don't necessarily need to be learned in the same way as active skills, but can be recognized, understood, and leveraged. It could also refer to environmental setups or external supports that help manage ADHD without constant active effort from the individual once established.</li>
    </ul>

  <section id="passive_strengths_section">
    <h2>Potential Passive Strengths/Traits (Characteristics to Recognize & Leverage)</h2>
    <p>These are traits sometimes associated with ADHD. They aren't universal and can manifest differently. They often need active skills (above) to be channeled productively.</p>
    <ul>
      <li id="creativity"><strong>Creativity & Innovative Thinking:</strong> A tendency towards seeing connections others miss, "out-of-the-box" problem-solving, and generating novel ideas.</li>

      <li id="high_energy"><strong>High Energy & Drive:</strong> Natural enthusiasm and ability to work intensely, particularly when engaged or passionate. Requires management to avoid burnout.</li>
      <li id="resilience"><strong>Resilience:</strong> An often-developed ability to bounce back from setbacks and adapt to adversity, partly learned through navigating life's challenges.</li>
      <li id="adaptability"><strong>Spontaneity & Adaptability:</strong> A tendency towards quick thinking and comfort with shifting gears or changing plans.</li>
      <li id="empathy"><strong>Empathy & Sensitivity:</strong> Often includes a deep attunement to the emotions and experiences of others.</li>
      <li id="curiosity"><strong>Curiosity:</strong> A strong intrinsic desire to learn, explore new things, and understand how things work.</li>

      <li id="novelty_seeking"><strong>Novelty Seeking:</strong> A drive towards new experiences, information, and stimuli which fuels curiosity.</li>
      <li id="risk_taking"><strong>Risk-Taking (Creative/Decisive):</strong> A potentially lower inhibition threshold that can lead to trying unconventional approaches or making faster decisions (needs active management).</li>
      <li id="daydreaming"><strong>Daydreaming/Mind-Wandering:</strong> The tendency for the mind to drift can sometimes lead to unexpected insights or creative incubation when not interfering with necessary focus.</li>
      <li id="emotional_intensity"><strong>Emotional Intensity (Creative):</strong> Experiencing emotions deeply can provide rich material and drive for expressive pursuits.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Important Context for Strengths:</strong> Not universal. Needs channeling with active skills. Environment matters.</p>

     </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="env_supports">
    <h3 id="environmental_supports">Environmental Supports (Setups that help passively once established)</h3>
    <p>These aren't inherent skills or traits, but external factors or systems, once set up (which takes active effort initially), provide ongoing passive support for managing ADHD symptoms.</p>
    <ul>
      <li id="structured_env"><strong>Structured Environments:</strong> Creating and maintaining predictable routines and highly organized physical and digital spaces to reduce cognitive load.</li>
      <li id="visual_aids_env"><strong>Visual Aids:</strong> Using timers, checklists, whiteboards, calendars, and other visual prompts placed strategically in the environment.</li>

      <li id="body_doubling"><strong>Body Doubling:</strong> The practice of working alongside someone else (physically present or virtually connected, often silently) to improve focus and task initiation/persistence.</li>
      <li id="noise_tools_env"><strong>Noise Management Tools:</strong> Having tools like earplugs, white noise machines, or noise-canceling headphones readily available and using them to manage auditory sensitivity or distractions.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

   <section id="final_notes">
    <h2>Final Notes</h2>
    <p>It's crucial to remember that ADHD presents differently in everyone. Developing active skills often requires significant effort and practice, sometimes with the help of therapists, coaches, or educational programs (like CBT or DBT adapted for ADHD). Recognizing and leveraging strengths, while valuable, also requires self-awareness and strategy.</p>
    <p>This visualization and explanation aim to provide an overview of common strategies and traits, not a diagnostic or treatment tool. Consult with qualified professionals for personalized advice.</p>
